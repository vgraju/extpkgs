A collection of IETF & IANA MIBs
--------------------------------

This is a set of IETF & IANA MIBs pre-compiled and packaged to
simplify their use with the PySNMP library [1].

All these files were autogenerated from ASN.1 MIB files using
PySMI [2] MIB compiler.

There is no strong need to use this package with modern PySNMP.
PySNMP 4.3+ automatically calls PySMI on ASN.1 MIB files to
compile MIBs into PySNMP format at the runtime.
